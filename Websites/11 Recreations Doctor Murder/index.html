		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>We're a group of doctors offering a final solution to what is likely not a temporary problem. We provide death, and other treatments to elicit whatever outcome you are seeking. Be it the aforementioned or something a little more specific. Some of our treatments we offer are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Death:</b> The patient of your choosing will be killed through a method that you select. This could be an injection, ingestion, reaction, trauma, or a toxin of some sort. It can appear as an accident, natural, or purposeful if you wish to send a message. The cost of this treatment ranges from $20,000 to $300,000 depending on the difficulty of the operation and the target.</li>
			<li><b>Torture:</b> If you don't want someone dead but do want them to suffer for whatever reason then we do offer services randing from limb removal, kidnapping, rape, or whatever it is you are thinking about. Whatever you can think up, we can make reality. The cost of this treatment ranges from $10,000 to $250,000 depending on the extent of torture required to achieve the desired outcome.</li>
			<li><b>Information:</b> Should you require confirmation or extrapolation on a topic then we have professionals who are extremely skilling in carving out whatever it is you seek to know. Interrogation techniques are one of our most sought after services. The cost of this treatment ranges from $25,000 to $150,000 depending on the time required to treat the patient and obtain information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We have doctors available in the United States, the EU, China, and Russia. Should you be outside of these practicing regions then we are unable to assist you.</p>

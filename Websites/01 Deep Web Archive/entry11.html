		<h1><span class="PTAG">The <span class="CFTAG">Truth</span></span></h1>
		<p class="paragraph-wrapper">The following Journal was discovered after the sudden <span class="CPTAG">disappearance</span> of a reclusive resident who lived in Oakland <span class="PTAG"></span> Oregon. There is no real evidence of what happened to them (at least in what was <span class="CFTAG">rleased</span> to the public by the local police force) however it was discovered that their truck was found <span class="CPTAG">abandoned</span> in a remote location outside of the town next to a random tree. Upon the completion of the <span class="PTAG"></span> official <span class="CPTAG">investigation</span> the extended family began to auction off belongings that were found in the man's home, including the very strange <span class="CFTAG">journal</span> that can be seen in the photos below. I hope <span class="PTAG"></span> that it does not need to be explained what this Journal seems to <span class="CPTAG">suggest</span>.</p>
